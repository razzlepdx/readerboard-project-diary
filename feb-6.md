# Entry for Feb. 6, 2018

#### Day 2 of project time

### Code I wrote today:

    Today I made my first templates:

    - base.html
    - index.html

    I also made some necessary changes to model.py based on feedback from yesterday, and got started on routes in server.py for oauth and getting users goodreads data.

### Problems I encountered:

    I was having a hard time translating the python code example into an app (using the functions and variables through routes instead of running a script on the terminal).  Katie was able to help me begin to position these pieces into my app, and I think I know what to do tomorrow to get things running!

### People that helped me:

    Katie B. helped me work through feedback from my mentor, encouraged me to stay focused on demo purposes only and walked through an oauth demo using the GR API with me.

### Resources I found:

    other hackbright projects using OAuth:
    [Fuder](https://github.com/aninahpets/Fuder)
    [RideThrift](https://github.com/nnegri/RideThrift)

    2 OAuth Libraries:
    [oauth2](https://github.com/joestump/python-oauth2)
    [requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib)


### Other notes:

    Other time was spent getting my project diary set up, and I was able to help a few classmates with issues they were having by serving as their rubber duck.
